### Bonjour 👋

I'm a student @Wild Code School and a devops trainee @Keyrus.

Random facts about me :
- 📚 Currently learning React, Docker & AWS.
- 🍬 Willy Wonka is my favorite guinea pig when it comes to user testing.
- 📖 When I don't code I read a lot, especially dystopias.
- 🎣 Don't EVER ask me to go fishing with you !
