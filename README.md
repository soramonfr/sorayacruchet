### Bonjour 👋

I started my career change in September 2020 after a few years in the chemistry industry.
I have worked as a DevOps and later as a Salesforce consultant but I am now circling back to my initial passion: front-end development.

👉 Therefore, the next months will be quite busy.

- 📖 When I don't code I read a lot, especially dystopias.
- 🎣 Don't EVER ask me to go fishing with you !
