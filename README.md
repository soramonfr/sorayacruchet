### Bonjour 👋

After a few years in the chemistry industry, I started my career change in September 2020.

Those last couple years allowed me to learn about front-end (html, css, javascript, react), back-end (php, nodejs), databases (mysql, mongoDb) and DevOps (docker, k8s, terraform, lens).

I am now currently a salesforce developer @CGI, learning the basis with @Social Builder.

Random facts about me :
- 📚 Currently learning Apex, JAVA, SOQL.
- 🍬 Willy Wonka is my favorite guinea pig when it comes to user testing.
- 📖 When I don't code I read a lot, especially dystopias.
- 🎣 Don't EVER ask me to go fishing with you !
