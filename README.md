### Bonjour 👋

Welcome to my github page !

I'm a full stack developer living currently in France 🇫🇷 . I’m working on my final graduation project, the repo will be public in April 2021 🙊 !

Random facts about me :
- 📚 Currently learning PHP Data Object and React.
- 🍬 Willy Wonka is my favorite guinea pig when it comes to user testing.
- 🔜 Looking for a work-study contract of one year.
- 📖 When I don't code I read a lot, especially dystopias.
- 🎣 Don't EVER ask me to go fishing with you !

My portfolio will come soon !
